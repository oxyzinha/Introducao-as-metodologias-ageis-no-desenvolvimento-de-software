            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Agile methodologies are a set of principles and practices for software development that prioritize
                flexibility, collaboration, and customer satisfaction. The Agile approach emerged as a response to the
                limitations of traditional, rigid development methodologies. It values iterative development,
                adaptability to change, and continuous improvement. Here's an introduction to some key concepts and
                principles of Agile methodologies.</p>

            <h1>Scrum</h1>

            <h2>Scrum</h2>

            <p>Scrum is a popular agile methodology in software development that focuses on iterative and incremental
                product delivery. Developed by Jeff Sutherland and Ken Schwaber in the 1990s, Scrum provides a
                flexible framework that emphasizes collaboration, transparency, and continuous adaptation. Here are
                some key concepts of Scrum:</p>
            <pre>

<h2>Scrum Team:</h2>

Scrum Team:


    A self-organizing, cross-functional team typically composed of developers, a Scrum Master, and a Product Owner.
    The team works together to achieve project objectives.

<h2>Sprints:</h2>

Sprints:

    
    Fixed time periods, usually two to four weeks, during which the Scrum team undertakes prioritized work to deliver a functional product increment.
    At the start of each sprint, there is a planning meeting.


<h2>Product Backlog:</h2>

Product Backlog:

    
    A prioritized list of features, enhancements, and fixes representing the work to be done in the project.
    The Product Owner is responsible for managing and prioritizing the Product Backlog.


<h2>Sprint Planning: </h2>
    
    A meeting at the beginning of each sprint where the Scrum team and the Product Owner collaborate to select tasks from the Product Backlog to be worked on during the sprint.

<h2>Daily Scrum (Stand-up):</h2>
    
    A short daily meeting, typically 15 minutes, where the Scrum team shares quick updates on progress, discusses impediments, and plans work for the next day.

<h2>Sprint Review:</h2>

Daily Scrum (Stand-up):

Sprint Review:

    
    A meeting held at the end of each sprint to showcase completed work to the Product Owner and other stakeholders.
    This meeting also includes a retrospective to assess what went well and what can be improved.

<h2>Product Owner:</h2>
    
    A representative of the customer or stakeholders responsible for defining priorities and ensuring that the Scrum team is building the most valuable features for the product.

<h2>Scrum Master:</h2>

Product Owner:
    
    A representative of the customer or stakeholders responsible for defining priorities and ensuring that the Scrum team is building the most valuable features for the product.

Scrum Master:

    The facilitator of the Scrum process, responsible for removing impediments, promoting a collaborative environment, and ensuring that the Scrum team adheres to Scrum practices and values.

Scrum offers flexibility to handle changes in requirements during development, allowing adjustments at each sprint. It promotes transparency as all involved parties have visibility into progress and can collaborate on decision-making. The focus on continuous delivery of valuable increments helps maximize customer satisfaction over time.
